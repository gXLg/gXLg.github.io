Used for `LibrGetter`. Use this feature whenever there is a new

Step 1: Join your sever with the plugin installed.

If there are different types of enchantment formats, please include all of then as a screenshot.
For example "Enchantment Solution" offers legacy books and own books in two different formats.
In this case, please make sure to include both types of formats in the issue.
